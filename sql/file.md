Configuring Azure DevOps correctly is pivotal to successfully integrate your Playwright tests. This section walks you through setting up Azure DevOps to handle test plans, test suites, and facilitate test case integration.

### Create an Azure DevOps Test Plan

A Test Plan acts as a container for your testing efforts, including individual test cases and test suites. Use the following steps to create a test plan within your project:

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps:** Log in to your Azure DevOps account and select the project where you want to integrate the Playwright tests.

2. **Access Test Plans:** From the sidebar navigation on the left, select "Test Plans." This area allows you to manage test plans, test suites, and test cases.

3. **Create a New Test Plan:** Click on "New Test Plan" to create a plan for your current testing efforts. Give it a meaningful name, such as "Playwright Automation," and add relevant details. Set the area and iteration paths to align with your project management structure, aiding in reporting and organization.

### Setting Up a Test Suite

Test Suites are groups of related test cases within a Test Plan. Organizing your Playwright tests into suites can help keep your testing structured and manageable.

1. **Add a Test Suite:** In the Test Plan you just created, click on "New Test Suite." Select either "Static Test Suite" if you want to manually manage test cases or "Requirement-based Test Suite" to link test cases to work items like user stories or tasks.

2. **Configure the Test Suite:** Give the test suite a descriptive name, for instance, "Login Functionality" for tests that validate authentication features.

3. **Assign Test Cases:** Here, you can add existing test cases or create new ones that will be automated with Playwright. To add a new test case, select "New Test Case," provide its name, and fill in the necessary details, such as steps, expected results, and any associated properties.

### Link Test Cases to Automation

With the Azure DevOps test suite ready, it's time to link your test cases to corresponding automated tests in Playwright.

1. **Automate Test Cases:** For every test case listed under the test suite, select the option "..." to open the context menu, and choose "Associate to Automation."

2. **Associate with Automated Test:** In the resulting dialog box, you need to link the manual test case to an automated test that will be written in Playwright. This typically involves specifying the automated test's name and providing the path that Azure DevOps will use to locate the automated test in your repository.

3. **Save Your Test Case:** After linking to automation, remember to save each test case to keep the associations intact.

### Preparing for Playwright Test Execution

Before starting with Playwright testing, there are additional considerations in Azure DevOps:

1. **Setting Up Agents:** Make sure that you have an Azure Pipeline agent capable of executing Playwright tests. You can use a Microsoft-hosted agent or set up a self-hosted agent that meets the requirements for running Playwright.

2. **Access to Resources:** Grant your pipeline access to the necessary resources, such as test environments, databases, or APIs, ensuring smooth execution of your Playwright tests.

3. **Service Connections:** If your Playwright tests interact with external services or third-party tools, create service connections from the "Project settings" to securely store credentials and facilitate communication.

By following these steps, you've laid the foundation for integrating Playwright into Azure DevOps. You've set up a test plan and test suite that aligns with your project, created and linked test cases for automated testing, and addressed considerations for executing tests.

## Configuring Playwright

After setting up your Azure DevOps environment, the next step is to prepare Playwright for writing and running tests locally. This section provides detailed instructions on how to configure Playwright in your local development environment.

### Starting a New Playwright Project

1. **Create a New Directory:** Start by making a new directory for your Playwright tests.
   ```sh
   mkdir my-playwright-tests
   cd my-playwright-tests
   ```

2. **Initialize a Node.js Project:** Inside the new directory, initialize a Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file using the `npm init` command. Follow the prompts to fill out basic project details or use `npm init -y` for a quick setup with defaults.
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install Playwright Test Runner:** Install the Playwright Test package as a dev dependency using npm.
   ```sh
   npm i -D @playwright/test
   ```

### Setting Up the Playwright Configuration

Playwright provides a default configuration file that can be customized to suit your project needs.

1. **Generate a Configuration File:** Use the Playwright CLI to initialize your test setup, which includes generating a sample configuration file.
   ```sh
   npx playwright init
   ```

2. **Modify the Configuration File:** Open the generated `playwright.config.js` file in your preferred editor. Here, you can specify settings like test directory, test matchers, reporter settings, and timeouts. For Azure DevOps integration, ensure that you set up the JUnit reporter to generate reports in XML format:
   ```javascript
   // playwright.config.js
   module.exports = {
     // testDir determines where your test files are located
     testDir: './tests',
     // Define test matchers if you want to customize test files naming
     testMatch: '**/*.spec.js',
     // Configure timeout for each individual test
     timeout: 30000,
     // Set up JUnit reporter for Azure DevOps integration
     reporter: [
       ['dot'], // Use the dot reporter or choose another for console output
       ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results.xml' }], // JUnit XML output
     ],
     // More configurations can be added as needed
   };
   ```

3. **Create Test Scripts Directory:** According to the test directory mentioned in the config file (`testDir`), create the directory for your test cases:
   ```sh
   mkdir tests
   ```

### Install Browsers

Playwright requires specific browsers to run tests. You can install them using Playwright CLI.

1. **Run Browser Installation:** This command will download the necessary browser binaries to your machine.
   ```sh
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Creating Your First Test Script

With Playwright set up, you can now begin writing tests. Here's an example of a basic test script:

1. **Create a New Test File:** Inside the 'tests' folder, create a file for your first test, e.g., `login.spec.js`.
   ```sh
   touch tests/login.spec.js
   ```

2. **Write a Basic Test:** Open `login.spec.js` and write a simple test using Playwright's API. Below is an example test that navigates to a website and checks for a specific element:
   ```javascript
   const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

   test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('https://example.com');
     const title = await page.title();
     expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');
   });
   ```

### Run Tests Locally

Before committing your tests, make sure to run them locally to verify that they work as expected:

1. **Execute Playwright Tests:**
   ```sh
   npx playwright test
   ```

2. **Review Test Results:** Check the console for test results and verify that the generated JUnit XML report (specified in the config) is created. This report is essential for integrating results with Azure DevOps.

### Version Control Integration

It's good practice to commit your Playwright tests into a version control system like Git.

1. **Initialize Git Repository:** If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory.
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files and Commit:** Add your project files to the repository and commit them.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with Playwright Test setup"
   ```

With this local setup complete, your Playwright environment is ready, and you are all set to write comprehensive tests for your application. Integration with Azure DevOps will enable you to execute these tests as part of your CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous quality assurance.

## Writing Playwright Test Cases

### Basic Test Case Structure

## Basic Test Case Structure

Writing effective Playwright test cases is crucial for end-to-end testing and maintaining high-quality software. This section covers the structure of a Playwright test case, offering a blueprint that you can use and adapt for different scenarios.

### Anatomy of a Playwright Test Case

A typical Playwright test case consists of the following components:

- **Import Statements:** Bring in the necessary modules from the Playwright library.
- **Test Suite:** Start defining your test suite with a description.
- **Test Hooks:** Optionally include hooks for setting up preconditions or cleaning up after tests.
- **Test Case:** Define the actual test case steps, including navigation, interactions, and assertions.

### Example Playwright Test Case

Below is a step-by-step example to illustrate the basic structure of a typical Playwright test case:

1. **Import Playwright Test Package:**
   ```javascript
   const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
   ```

2. **Test Suite:**
   ```javascript
   test.describe('User Login Tests', () => {
     // You can include test hooks here.

     test('should navigate to the login page and log in successfully', async ({ page }) => {
       // Steps for individual test case
     });
     
     // More test cases can be added here.
   });
   ```

3. **Test Hooks (Optional):**
   ```javascript
   test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
     // Code to run before each test, e.g., navigate to a common starting point.
   });

   test.afterEach(async ({ page }) => {
     // Code to run after each test, e.g., clear cookies or local storage.
   });
   ```

4. **Test Case:**
   ```javascript
   // Inside the test.describe block
   test('should navigate to the login page and log in successfully', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('https://example.com/login'); // Navigate to the login page.
     await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'testuser'); // Fill in the username.
     await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'securepassword'); // Fill in the password.
     await page.click('button#login'); // Click the login button.

     // Use assertions to verify outcomes, such as successful navigation after login.
     await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://example.com/dashboard');
   });
   ```

### Assertions and Expectations

In your test cases, you will use assertions to check if the test's expectations are met. Assertions are crucial as they determine the pass or fail status of your test case.

Example of assertions using the `expect` API:

```javascript
// Checking if an element's text content equals a certain value.
await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Welcome, Test User!');

// Asserting that an element is visible on the page.
await expect(page.locator('.notification.success')).toBeVisible();
```

### Running and Debugging Test Cases

To run your tests, use the Playwright CLI command:

```sh
npx playwright test
```

For debugging, Playwright offers built-in tools like `page.pause()` for interactive debugging, and you can run tests with the `--debug` flag:

```sh
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Organizing Test Files and Suites

It is advisable to structure your Playwright tests into files and suites that reflect the components or features of your application. For example, all tests relating to user authentication might reside in a `login.tests.js` file within a "User Authentication Tests" suite.

```javascript
// Example file name: tests/user-authentication/login.tests.js
```

By following these guidelines, you ensure that you have a solid foundation for writing Playwright test cases that are easy to maintain and integrate with Azure DevOps Test Lab. With well-structured test cases, you can automatically update test results in Azure DevOps and generate comprehensive JUnit XML reports, complete with PDF attachments, to keep track of your test outcomes and improve the quality and reliability of your software delivery.

### Connecting to Azure DevOps Test Lab

## Connecting to Azure DevOps Test Lab

Linking Playwright test cases to Azure DevOps Test Lab is a critical step to track and manage your test results automatically. This process involves ensuring your automated Playwright tests send updates to Azure DevOps after each execution. The following instructions guide you through connecting Playwright test cases with Azure DevOps Test Lab.

### Preparing the Connection

Before you can update test results in Azure DevOps, you need to make sure your Playwright tests are associated with the correct test cases in your Azure DevOps project.

1. **Associate Tests:** Refer to the Azure DevOps documentation to link your Playwright tests to Azure DevOps test cases. This usually involves setting the test case ID in your test scripts.

2. **API Access:** Your script will need to make calls to the Azure DevOps Services REST API. Ensure you have the required permissions and create a Personal Access Token (PAT) if necessary. Permissions should include the ability to read and write test results.

### Generating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Follow these steps in Azure DevOps to generate a PAT:

1. **Access User Settings:** Click on your profile picture in the top right corner of Azure DevOps and select "Security."

2. **Create New Token:** Select "Personal access tokens" and then "New Token." Provide a name for the token, an expiration date, and the necessary scopes (e.g., "Test Management: Read and write").

3. **Save the Token:** Copy the generated token and store it securely. You cannot view it again after you leave the token creation page.

### Updating Test Results Programmatically

Once your Playwright tests are ready and your PAT is generated, follow these general steps to update test results in Azure DevOps Test Lab:

1. **Include Azure DevOps API Module:**
   - In your project, you might create a utility module that handles interaction with the Azure DevOps API.
   - Install a module for making HTTP requests, like `axios`, if not already available.

2. **API Functionality:**
   - Create a function to send test result updates to Azure DevOps, using the REST API endpoint for updating test results.
   - Use the PAT for authentication when making API calls.

### Example Code Snippet for API Interaction

Here's an example of how you could define a function that interacts with the Azure DevOps REST API in your test script or a separate module:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const updateTestResult = async (testPlanId, testSuiteId, testCaseId, outcome, runId, authToken) => {
  const url = `https://dev.azure.com/YourOrganization/YourProject/_apis/test/Runs/${runId}/results?api-version=6.0`;
  const headers = { 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(`:${authToken}`).toString('base64')}`
  };
  const body = [
    {
      "id": testCaseId,
      "outcome": outcome, // Can be "Passed", "Failed", or other acceptable outcomes.
      "state": "Completed"
      // Include other details as required by the Azure API.
    }
  ];

  try {
    const response = await axios.patch(url, body, { headers: headers });
    console.log(`Test result updated for case ID ${testCaseId}:`, response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to update test result for case ID ${testCaseId}:`, error);
  }
};
```

### Integrating Update Function in Playwright Tests

You would call the `updateTestResult` function in the afterEach hook or within the individual tests' catch block when handling test failures:

```javascript
test.afterEach(async (testInfo) => {
  // Get details like testPlanId, testSuiteId, testCaseId, and runId from testInfo or environment variables.
  const outcome = testInfo.status === 'passed' ? 'Passed' : 'Failed';
  await updateTestResult(testPlanId, testSuiteId, testCaseId, outcome, runId, process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT);
});
```

### Considerations

- **Security:** Be careful handling the PAT, using environment variables or secure methods to store and access it in your scripts.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your API calls to ensure reliability.
- **Pipeline Integration:** When running tests in Azure Pipelines, make sure that test runs are correctly identified, and that environment variables are set up for the PAT and other test metadata.

By connecting Playwright to Azure DevOps Test Lab, you will create a powerful feedback loop, allowing you to address issues quickly and maintain high test coverage. Proper configuration and connection streamline the test management process and enhance the overall productivity and efficiency of your development workflow.

### Using Azure Service Principals

---
title: Guide to Integrating Playwright Tests with Azure DevOps
section: Authentication and Bypassing Azure Entra Login
subsection: Using Azure Service Principals
---

## Using Azure Service Principals

For automated testing, manual login processes such as Azure Entra (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) login prompts can be a hurdle. Service principals, which are identity objects, provide a way to grant an application access to specific Azure resources, allowing it to authenticate and bypass the interactive login process. This guide outlines the steps to create and use an Azure service principal for authentication in your automated Playwright tests.

### Step 1: Creating a Service Principal in Azure

Follow these steps to create a service principal in the Azure portal:

1. **Sign in to Azure Portal:**
   Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Azure Active Directory:**
   From the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory."

3. **App Registrations:**
   Click on "App registrations" in the Azure Active Directory sidebar menu.

4. **New Registration:**
   Click the "New registration" button at the top of the main panel.

5. **Register an Application:**
   Fill in the details for the application:
   - **Name:** Provide a meaningful name for your service principal.
   - **Supported account types:** Select which accounts can use this application.
   - **Redirect URI (optional):** Set this if needed for your application.
   
   Click "Register" to create the service principal.

### Step 2: Generate Client Secret for the Service Principal

After registration, you'll need a client secret to authenticate:

1. **Certificates & Secrets:**
   In the app registration's left-hand menu, go to "Certificates & secrets."

2. **New Client Secret:**
   Click on "New client secret," provide a description, choose an expiration period, and click "Add."

3. **Copy and Store the Secret:**
   Copy the client secret value immediately as you won't be able to retrieve it after you leave this page. Securely store this value as you would a password.

### Step 3: Configure Permissions for the Service Principal

Ensure your service principal has the necessary permissions:

1. **API Permissions:**
   In the service principal's menu, go to "API permissions."

2. **Add a Permission:**
   Click "Add a permission" and choose the needed permissions for your tests to run. For example, you might need access to Microsoft Graph or custom APIs.

3. **Grant Admin Consent:**
   After adding permissions, click "Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]" to make these permissions active.

### Step 4: Note Down Your Service Principal Details

For your service principal, you will need the following details:

- **Tenant ID:** Found under the Azure Active Directory properties.
- **Client ID:** Found in the overview of your app registration.
- **Client Secret:** The value you copied when creating the secret.

### Step 5: Use Environment Variables to Store Credentials

For security reasons, store your service principal credentials as environment variables rather than hard-coding them into your test scripts:

```sh
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

### Step 6: Implementing Service Principal Authentication in Playwright

In Playwright, use the service principal credentials to obtain a token, which will be used to bypass the login UI:

```javascript
const { msal } = require('@azure/msal-node');

const msalConfig = {
  auth: {
    clientId: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID,
    authority: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/${process.env.AZURE_TENANT_ID}`,
    clientSecret: process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  }
};

const cca = new msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(msalConfig);

async function getToken() {
  const tokenResponse = await cca.acquireTokenByClientCredential({
    scopes: ["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"], // Change to the scopes you need for your API.
  });
  return tokenResponse.accessToken;
}

// Use the token to set authorization headers or cookies,
// depending on your application, to bypass the login screen.
```

Remember, you must handle and store your credentials securely and avoid exposing them in your code. Utilize environment variables or key vaults for any sensitive information, and make sure that only authorized pipeline agents or machines have access to these secrets.

By following these steps, you can effectively bypass manual Azure Entra logins and streamline your automated Playwright tests within Azure Pipelines, ensuring enhanced security and a consistent testing environment.

### Bypassing Login in Test Cases

---
title: Guide to Integrating Playwright Tests with Azure DevOps
section: Authentication and Bypassing Azure Entra Login
subsection: Bypassing Login in Test Cases

## Bypassing Login in Test Cases

Automated test cases often stumble upon login flows, which can add complexity and flakiness to the testing process. By leveraging a service principal, you can bypass the Azure Entra login page within your Playwright test cases. This section guides you through the process of bypassing the login steps in automated tests.

### Preparing Access Token Retrieval

After creating your service principal (as detailed in "Using Azure Service Principals"), you will use it to authenticate your Playwright test cases without interacting with the login UI.

1. **Access Token Function**: Define a function in your test scripts or in a separate utilities module that uses the service principal credentials to get an access token for your app. Refer to the previous guide for the function sample that uses MSAL.

2. **Scope Configuration**: Make sure to request a token with appropriate scopes that match your application's requirements.

### Bypassing the Login UI Using Cookies or Headers

With the token at hand, you can either:

- Set an authorization cookie if your application uses cookie-based authentication.
- Add an authorization header if your application expects the token in the request headers.

### Bypassing Login with Cookies

Here's an example of how to set a cookie with the access token obtained from a service principal:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a getAccessToken function as described in previous sections.
const { test } = require('@playwright/test');

// Obtain an access token before running your tests.
const accessToken = await getAccessToken();

test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
  // You are setting the cookie on the browser context, so it applies to all pages within that context.
  await context.addCookies([
    {
      name: 'auth-token',
      value: accessToken,
      domain: 'your-app-domain.com',
      path: '/',
      httpOnly: true, // Set cookie properties as they are expected by your application.
      secure: true,
    }
  ]);
});

test('should bypass the login page and go directly to the dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-app-domain.com/dashboard');
  
  // Rest of your test code here.
});
```

### Bypassing Login with Headers

Alternatively, include the token in the authorization header for each request:

```javascript
const { test } = require('@playwright/test');

test.use({
  extraHTTPHeaders: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
});

test('should bypass the login page and go directly to the dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-app-domain.com/dashboard');
  
  // Rest of your test code here.
});
```

### Verifying Bypass and Securing Tokens

Ensure that:

- The bypass works correctly by running tests which check for elements that would only be visible when logged in successfully.
- Your service principal has the minimum permissions necessary to perform actions as the test user.
- Access tokens are securely stored, preferably using environment variables or Azure Key Vault, and never embedded directly in the code.

### Additional Considerations

- **Session Duration**: Pay attention to the lifetime of access tokens and refresh them if needed during long-running test suites.
- **Environment Specificity**: Be aware that your method of bypassing authentication may vary between different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Security Measures**: Understand your application's security mechanisms to ensure that setting headers or cookies aligns with your application's expectations and doesn't compromise security layers.

By incorporating service principals into your Playwright test cases, you not only simplify the testing process but also make it more reliable. This method offers a sustainable, secure alternative to dealing with interactive logins, which can help expedite both local test cycles and CI/CD pipeline executions in Azure DevOps.

## Running Tests in Azure Pipeline

## Configuring Azure Pipeline

To run your Playwright tests as part of your continuous integration (CI) process, you need to set up an Azure Pipeline that will execute the tests every time changes are pushed to your repository or according to defined triggers. This guide provides detailed instructions on creating an Azure Pipeline that is optimized for running Playwright tests.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that:

- You have an Azure DevOps account and your repository is hosted on Azure Repos or another version control system supported by Azure Pipelines (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).
- Your Playwright tests are located in your repository and configured as described in the previous sections.
- You have the required permissions to create and configure pipelines in your Azure DevOps project.

### Step 1: Create a New Azure Pipeline

1. **Access Azure DevOps:** Log into your Azure DevOps account and select your project.
2. **Access Pipelines:** Click on "Pipelines" in the left-hand sidebar and then click "New pipeline."
3. **Select Source:** Follow the wizard to select the repository where your test scripts are stored.
4. **Configure the Pipeline:** Choose to start with a starter pipeline or an existing Azure Pipelines YAML file if you have one.

### Step 2: Define the Pipeline Structure

Create an `azure-pipelines.yml` file in the root of your repository if you don't already have one, and define the structure as follows:

```yaml
trigger:
- main  # Modify if you wish to trigger on different/multiple branches.

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Choose an appropriate agent pool based on your requirements.

steps:
- script: |
    echo 'Starting Playwright Tests'
  displayName: 'Display Message'

# Additional steps will be added below.
```

### Step 3: Install Node.js

Add a step to install Node.js, which is required to run Playwright:

```yaml
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'  # Set this to the Node.js version you're using.
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'
```

### Step 4: Install Playwright and Browsers

Include steps to install dependencies and browsers required for Playwright:

```yaml
- script: |
    npm install
  displayName: 'Install dependencies'

- script: |
    npx playwright install
  displayName: 'Install browsers'
```

### Step 5: Run Playwright Tests

Add the main step to execute your Playwright tests:

```yaml
- script: |
    npx playwright test --reporter=junit,html
  env:
    # Set the necessary environment variables, if any.
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID: $(AZURE_CLIENT_ID)
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: $(AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)
    AZURE_TENANT_ID: $(AZURE_TENANT_ID)
  displayName: 'Run Playwright Tests'
```

### Step 6: Publish Test Results

Finally, add steps to publish your test results and any artefacts like screenshots or videos:

```yaml
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: '**/test-results.xml'  # Update the pattern to match your JUnit results file location.
    failTaskOnFailedTests: true
  displayName: 'Publish Test Results'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    # Define paths and names for your artefacts.
    pathToPublish: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/path-to-artifacts'
    artifactName: 'playwright-artifacts'
  displayName: 'Publish Artifacts'
```

### Configuring Service Connections

If your repository is in GitHub or another external service, create and configure a service connection in Azure DevOps to access it:

1. **Open Project Settings:** From the bottom-left corner of your Azure DevOps project, click "Project settings."
2. **Select Service Connections:** Under Pipelines, click "Service connections" and then "New service connection." Choose the appropriate type (e.g., GitHub).
3. **Follow the Wizard:** Fill out the necessary details for the service connection and complete the setup.

### Pipeline Variables and Secrets

Store sensitive values like your Azure service principal credentials as pipeline secrets:

1. **Define Variables:** In your pipeline definition in Azure DevOps, click "Variables."
2. **Add Secrets:** Click "New variable" for each secret, provide the name and value, and click the lock icon to make it a secret.

### Running the Pipeline

Once configured, you can run the pipeline manually through the Azure DevOps UI or automatically by committing changes to the repository, depending on your trigger configuration.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Azure Pipeline to execute Playwright tests, ensuring continuous testing as part of your DevOps pipeline. This automation helps maintain software quality by allowing you to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

## Creating and Attaching JUnit XML and PDF Reports

An essential aspect of running automated tests in a CI/CD pipeline is the ability to review and share the results. This section will walk you through generating JUnit XML reports and attaching PDFs of test results in Azure Pipelines, enabling you to maintain a permanent record of test outcomes, which is crucial for analysis and audit purposes.

### Generating JUnit XML Reports

Playwright's test runner can generate JUnit XML reports natively, which can be used to report test results in Azure Pipelines. The JUnit XML reporter gets specified when running the Playwright test command.

1. **Update Playwright Test Command:**

   Add the JUnit reporter to your test command in the Azure Pipelines YAML configuration:

   ```yaml
   - script: |
       npx playwright test --reporter=junit
     displayName: 'Run Playwright Tests'
   ```

2. **Specify Output Directory (Optional):**

   Additionally, you can specify where the report should be saved by passing an argument to the reporter option:

   ```yaml
   - script: |
       npx playwright test --reporter=junit:results/test-results.xml
     displayName: 'Run Playwright Tests'
   ```

   In this case, you are directing the reports to be stored in a `results` directory with the filename `test-results.xml`.

### Attaching PDF Reports

You can enhance the test reports by adding PDF outputs of the test results. To generate PDF reports, you will typically use a separate tool or library that converts XML or HTML reports into PDFs.

1. **Generate HTML Report:**

   First, obtain an HTML report that can be converted to a PDF.

   ```yaml
   - script: |
       npx playwright test --reporter=html
     displayName: 'Generate HTML Report'
   ```

2. **Convert HTML to PDF:**

   Use a tool such as wkhtmltopdf or a Node.js package like `puppeteer` to convert the HTML report to a PDF file.

   ```yaml
   - script: |
       wkhtmltopdf results/report.html results/report.pdf
     displayName: 'Convert HTML Report to PDF'
   ```

   Ensure that the conversion tool is installed on the agent running the pipeline or add steps to install it as part of the pipeline process.

3. **Publish PDF Reports as Artifacts:**

   After converting to PDF, publish the reports as pipeline artifacts.

   ```yaml
   - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
     inputs:
       pathToPublish: 'results/report.pdf'
       artifactName: 'playwright-pdf-reports'
     displayName: 'Publish PDF Reports'
   ```

### Publishing JUnit XML Reports

Once you have generated the JUnit XML reports, publish them in Azure Pipelines to be visualized in the test results section.

1. **Publish Test Results Task:**

   Add the `PublishTestResults` task to your pipeline configuration to publish the JUnit XML results.

   ```yaml
   - task: PublishTestResults@2
     condition: succeededOrFailed()
     inputs:
       testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
       testResultsFiles: '**/test-results.xml'
       failTaskOnFailedTests: true
       mergeTestResults: true
     displayName: 'Publish Test Results'
   ```

   Configure the `testResultsFiles` parameter to point to the correct location of your JUnit XML report file.

### Best Practices for Report Management

- **Persistent Storage:** Whenever possible, store test reports and related artifacts in a durable storage service such as Azure Blob Storage for long-term retention.
- **Access Control:** Ensure that access to test reports is controlled and only authorized users can view or download them.
- **Descriptive Filenames:** Use meaningful file names for your reports, potentially incorporating the test run id, timestamp, or other identifiers to distinguish between different runs.
- **Automation:** If generating PDFs from HTML reports is a standard requirement, consider automating the entire process with a custom script or a toolchain that fits naturally within your Azure Pipeline.

With JUnit XML and PDF test reports successfully integrated into your Azure Pipelines, stakeholders can easily access comprehensive test outcomes, allowing for better insight into the health and stability of the software product. These reports not only serve immediate needs during the CI/CD process but also contribute to documentation and compliance requirements in software development lifecycles.
